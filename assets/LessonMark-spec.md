# LessonMark notation – specification (version 0.10)

LessonMark turns ONE plain-text lesson file (usually `data.md`) into an interactive lesson page.
The page is strict: anything not written exactly as described here is shown as plain text,
breaks an exercise, or appears in a red "Check your lesson file" box. Follow this document
literally. When in doubt, copy the examples and change only the words.

The finished file opens in two ways: pasted into (or chosen on) LessonMark online, or saved as
`data.md` in the same folder as `index.html` and its media files.

11 Common mistakes · 12 Final checklist · 13 Complete example


## 1. Output

- The output is the lesson file and nothing else: no greeting, no explanation, no answer key,
  no notes outside `[teacher]`, no "eof", no summary inside the file.
- If you can create files, create `data.md` containing only the lesson.
- If you answer in a chat, put the whole file in ONE code block that starts with ```` ```markdown ````
  and ends with ```` ``` ````. Nothing else goes inside that block. Anything for the teacher
  (a summary, assumptions) goes AFTER the closing ```` ``` ````, never inside it.
- The first line of the file is `---` (the header). The last line is the last line of the lesson,
  usually `[/teacher]`.
- Never use ```` ``` ```` inside the lesson itself.


## 2. Ten golden rules

1. **Tags start at the beginning of a line** and are written in lowercase: `[tf]`, `[m]`, `[play …]`.
2. **Block tags always open and close on their own lines**: `[m]` … `[/m]`. Never write an exercise
   block on one line. Every block you open, you close with the same name: `[fix]` … `[/fix]`.
3. **Single-line tags never get a closing tag**: `[tf]`, `[short]`, `[odd]`, `[discuss]`, `[play]`,
   `[img]`, `[timer]`, `[link]`. Write the whole item on one line.
4. **Inside tags use straight double quotes** `"…"` for titles, captions, labels and speaker names.
   Curly quotes `“…”` inside a tag break it. (Curly quotes in normal text are fine.)
5. **Curly braces always make a gap.** Never write `{` or `}` for any other purpose.
   Write `\{` `\}` if you need the symbols. Use gaps only where section 9 allows them.
6. **A line that starts with `[word]` is read as a tag.** Never start a normal line with
   `[Music]`, `[Pause]`, `[Note]`, `[Answer]` or similar. (`[Music]` is fine inside `[transcript]`.)
7. **`=` introduces an answer only where this document says so.** In `[transform]` the `=` signs
   mark the gap inside the sentence: they never start the line.
8. **`|` separates accepted alternatives** only in gaps, `[short]`, `[fix]` and `[transform]`.
   Never in `[long]`, `[m]`, `[tf]`, `[match]` or anywhere else.
9. **Never write numbers, letters or keys yourself.** The page numbers exercises and items,
   letters the options, shuffles matching and ordering, and builds the answer key.
10. **Use only the tags in section 6.** No HTML, no other tags, no invented options.

## 4. Header

The file starts with a header between two lines that contain only `---`.
One `key: value` per line. Only these keys exist:

| Key | Required | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `title:` | yes | Lesson title. |
| `subtitle:` | no | One-line tagline under the title. |
| `level:` | no | e.g. `B2`, `C1`. |
| `course:` | no | Small label above the title, e.g. `English for Architects`. Default: "Lesson". |
| `intro:` | no | One short paragraph that sets the scene. One line in the file. |
| `meta:` | no | One line of practical facts: length, source, files. Separate items with ` · `. |
| `style:` | no | Exactly one word: `classic`, `modern`, `editorial`, `blueprint`, `concrete` or `notebook`. Default `classic`. Nothing else on the line. |

Each value stays on ONE line. No quotes around values. No other keys.


## 5. Structure and plain text

```
# Part 1 – Before you watch              ← part title: not numbered, not an exercise
## Key vocabulary | Pairs · 5 minutes    ← exercise: numbered automatically
> Match the words with their meanings.   ← rubric (instructions to students)
### Group A                              ← optional subheading inside an exercise
```

- `#` = part title. It closes the current exercise.
- `##` = an exercise. Everything until the next `#` or `##` belongs to it. Text after ` | `
  (space, bar, space) is the detail line, shown small under the title:
  `Interaction · minutes`, for example `Pairs · 5 minutes`. Interaction is one of
  `Individual`, `Pairs`, `Groups`, `Whole class`.
- Do not write "Exercise 1", "1.", "Task A" in titles: numbering is automatic.
- Every `##` starts with exactly one rubric line starting with `> ` written to students.
- `###` = optional subheading inside an exercise.
- Every graded item (gaps, `[tf]`, `[m]`, `[short]`, `[fix]` …) must be inside a `##` exercise.
- Plain Markdown that works: paragraphs (separate with a blank line), `**bold**`, `*italics*`,
  `` `code` ``, `[link text](https://…)`, lists (`- item` or `1. item`), and tables:

```
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Bridges built | {about 400} |
```

- Lines that start with `-`, `*`, `+` or `1.` become list items. Lines that start with `>` become
  rubrics. Lines that start with `#` become headings. Lines that start with `|` followed by a
  `|---|` line become a table.
- No HTML. No images in Markdown syntax (use `[img]`). No footnotes.


## 6. Tag overview

| Tag | Kind | Form | Closing tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[play src start end "label"]` | presentation | single line | none |
| `[img file options "caption"]` | presentation | single line | none |
| `[timer 5:00 "label"]` | presentation | single line | none |
| `[link url "title"]` | presentation | single line | none |
| `[read]` | presentation | block | `[/read]` |
| `[transcript "label"]` | presentation | block | `[/transcript]` |
| `[note "title"]` | presentation | block | `[/note]` |
| `[vocab "title"]` | presentation | block | `[/vocab]` |
| `[phrases "title"]` | presentation | block | `[/phrases]` |
| `[roles]` | presentation | block | `[/roles]` |
| `[timeline]` | presentation | block | `[/timeline]` |
| `[quote "speaker"]` | presentation | block | `[/quote]` |
| `[teacher]` | presentation | block | `[/teacher]` |
| `{answer}` and variants | exercise | inside text | none |
| `[tf] … [t]` / `[f]` | exercise | single line | none |
| `[short] … = …` | exercise | single line | none |
| `[odd] …` | exercise | single line | none |
| `[discuss] …` | exercise (not graded) | single line | none |
| `[m]` | exercise | block | `[/m]` |
| `[long]` | exercise | block | `[/long]` |
| `[fix]` | exercise | block | `[/fix]` |
| `[transform] … (KEY)` | exercise | block | `[/transform]` |
| `[match]` | exercise | block | `[/match]` |
| `[order]` | exercise | block | `[/order]` |
| `[sort]` | exercise | block | `[/sort]` |
| `[bank]` or `[bank + extra, words]` | exercise | block | `[/bank]` |

A block tag line may carry its options and a quoted title, but its content always starts on the
NEXT line, and the closing tag is alone on its own line.


## 7. Presentation blocks (never numbered, never graded)

### Media clip – `[play]`
```
[play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2hnrfN58H4 00:06 01:25 "Clip A – the land and the river"]
[play audio.mp3 00:47 01:50 "Clip A – building on mud"]
[play video.mp4 01:58 03:09 "Clip B – bridges and canals"]
```
- Order: source, start time, end time, "label". One space between parts.
- Source: a YouTube link (`youtube.com/watch?v=…`, `youtu.be/…`, `/shorts/…`), or a file name
  in the same folder (`.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.wav`, `.ogg` play as audio; `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov` as video),
  or a full web address of such a file.
- Times: `mm:ss` (or `hh:mm:ss`), digits only: `01:26`, not `1m26s`, not `86`. End after start.
  Leaving out the end time plays to the end; leaving out both plays everything.
- Label: in straight double quotes, short, telling: `"Clip A – the land and the river"`.
- The same clip may be repeated in several exercises (copy the line).

### Transcript – `[transcript]`
```
[transcript "Transcript (after you have finished)"]
Rob Mills: As an architect, it gives you the opportunity to capture space and light.
Narrator: The house sits low in the landscape.
[Music]
[/transcript]
```
- Put it directly after the `[play]` line it belongs to (blank lines between are fine).
  It then appears folded inside that player.
- One line per turn. `Name: text` shows the name in bold: the name starts with a capital letter,
  is at most 30 characters, and is followed by a colon and a space.
- Use real names or roles (`Rob Mills`, `Narrator`, `Interviewer`), never `Speaker 1`, `Speaker 2`.
- A line that is entirely in brackets (`[Music]`, `[Laughter]`) is shown as a sound cue.
- No gaps inside.

### Reading text – `[read]`
```
[read numbered] The House on the River | Original text written for this lesson
The first paragraph. The first letter gets a drop cap.

The second paragraph, after a blank line.
[/read]
```
- On the tag line, after `[read]` or `[read numbered]`: optional title, then ` | ` and optional source.
- `numbered` adds paragraph numbers in the margin.
- Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. Gaps `{…}` work inside (the text then becomes part
  of the current exercise).

### Image – `[img]`
```
[img image01.png "Plan of the ground floor"]
[img image02.png right "The staircase and skylight"]
[img logo.png left transparent "The studio's logo"]
```
- Order: file name, then options, then "caption". Options: `full` (default), `left`, `right`,
  `transparent`. No other options exist.
- Two or three `[img]` lines in a row (no blank line between them) form a grid.
- Always write a caption. Only use image files the teacher said they will supply.

### Fact box – `[note]`
```
[note "Did you know?"]
The Rialto Bridge rests on about 12,000 wooden piles.
[/note]
```

### Vocabulary list – `[vocab]` (reference, not an exercise)
```
[vocab "Key words"]
cantilever = a beam supported at only one end
load-bearing = carrying the weight of the structure above
[/vocab]
```
- One `term = meaning` per line. The first `=` separates them.

### Useful language – `[phrases]`
```
[phrases "Useful language"]
It could be argued that…
I take the point, but…
[/phrases]
```
- One phrase per line.

### Role cards – `[roles]`
```
[roles]
Client: Wants a home that feels hidden in the landscape.
Architect: Wants to show the river from every room.
[/roles]
```
- One `Role: description` per line.

### Timeline – `[timeline]`
```
[timeline]
1181 = A pontoon bridge is built
1591 = The stone bridge opens
[/timeline]
```
- One `when = what` per line.

### Pull quote – `[quote]`
```
[quote "Rob Mills"]
Less is more.
[/quote]
```
- The speaker in straight double quotes on the tag line: a real name or role, never `Speaker 2`.
- Quote the exact words, at most 15 words.

### Timer – `[timer]`
```
[timer 5:00 "Discuss in pairs"]
```
- Time as `m:ss` or `mm:ss`, then an optional "label".

### Link card – `[link]`
```
[link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2hnrfN58H4 "Watch the full video"]
```

### Teacher's notes – `[teacher]`
```
[teacher]
**Clips.** A 00:06–01:25 (site), B 01:26–03:24 (interiors).

**If time is short,** skip exercise 6.
[/teacher]
```
- Shown folded at the end of the page, for the teacher only. Markdown works inside; gaps do not.
- Use one `[teacher]` block, at the end of the file.


## 8. Exercises

Each graded item gets Check / Show / Clear buttons and goes into the answer key automatically.
Typed gaps and short answers also get a folded "Need help? Word bank" automatically.

### Gap fill – `{answer}`
```
The settlers drove wooden {piles} into the mud and created an {oxygen-free|oxygen free} environment.
```
- The answer goes inside the braces, exactly as it completes the sentence.
- Accepted alternatives separated by `|`. The first one is the main answer.
- One gap per idea. Never two gaps next to each other.

### Dropdown gap – `{*right|wrong|wrong}`
```
The bridge {*was|were|has been} completed in 1591.
```
- 2–4 options separated by `|`. Exactly one starts with `*` (the correct one).

### Word formation – `{answer}(BASE)`
```
The {construction}(CONSTRUCT) took ten years.
```
- The base word in capitals in round brackets, immediately after the closing brace, no space.

### Gap fill with a word bank – `[bank]`
```
[bank + timber, glass]
The kitchen combines {bronze} and {alabaster} to create a {grounded} space.
[/bank]
```
- Write the text with gaps between `[bank]` and `[/bank]`. The page puts every gap answer
  into the bank by itself: do NOT list the answers.
- Optional extra (distractor) words after `+`, separated by commas, on the tag line.
  Extra words must NOT be answers of the gaps.
- Use one `[bank]` block per exercise. Write the text as normal sentences or a paragraph;
  do not number the lines.

### True or false – `[tf]`
```
[tf] The client already owned the land when he met the architect. [t]
[tf] The house was designed to stand out on top of the hill. [f]
```
- One statement per line, ending with `[t]` (true) or `[f]` (false). No gaps.

### Multiple choice – `[m]`
```
[m] Why did the designer travel overseas?
- To find cheaper building materials
* To find pieces that are hard to get in Australia
- To study French building methods
[/m]
```
- First line(s): the question. Then one option per line: `* ` for the correct option,
  `- ` for wrong options (the symbol, then a space). Exactly one `*`. 3–4 options.
- Nothing after the options except `[/m]`: no explanations, no "Answer:" lines.
- One question per `[m]` block. For several questions, write several blocks.

### Short answer – `[short]`
```
[short] What kind of tree grows at the base of the stairs? = a bottle tree|bottle tree
```
- Question, then ` = `, then the answer(s) on the same line. Answers are 1–3 words.
  Separate alternatives with `|`. List every reasonable form.

### Long answer – `[long]`
```
[long] Why does the architect call the house holistic?
= Because architecture, interiors, landscape, art and furniture were designed together as one project, not as separate disciplines.
[/long]
```
- The question, then ONE line starting with `= ` with one suggested answer (1–3 sentences).
- No `|`, no alternatives, no "Suggested answer:" label (the page adds it).
- Not auto-checked: students compare with the suggestion.

### Matching – `[match]`
```
[match]
holistic = treating all the parts as one whole
cocooning = making a space feel warm and enclosed
respite = a short rest from something difficult
[/match]
```
- One `term = definition` per line, in the correct pairs. The page shuffles them.
- 4–8 pairs. The term may not contain `=`.

### Ordering – `[order]`
```
[order]
The client buys the land.
The team writes the story of the house.
The designer travels to source furniture.
[/order]
```
- One item per line, in the CORRECT order. The page shuffles them. 3–8 items. No numbers.

### Error correction – `[fix]`
```
[fix]
The relationship creating by the building affects how clients feel.
= The relationship created by the building affects how clients feel.
[/fix]
```
- Line 1: a sentence that contains exactly ONE mistake.
- Line 2: ONE line starting with `= ` with the full corrected sentence. Accepted alternatives
  on the same line, separated by `|`.
- The wrong sentence must really be wrong. Never use `[fix]` for sentences that are already
  correct ("rewrite", "make it more formal", "use a participle"): use `[transform]` for that.
- One sentence per `[fix]` block. For several sentences, write several blocks.

### Key word transformation – `[transform]`
```
[transform]
Rob Mills values his relationships with clients more than anything else. (WHAT)
The relationships with clients = are what Rob Mills values = most.
[/transform]
```
WRONG – this is the most common mistake:
```
[transform]
Rob Mills values his relationships with clients more than anything else. (WHAT)
= The relationships with clients are what Rob Mills values = most.
[/transform]
```
The correct form, exactly:
```
[transform]
First sentence. (KEYWORD)
Start of the new sentence = answer|alternative answer = end of the new sentence.
[/transform]
```
- Line 1: the original sentence, then the key word in CAPITALS in round brackets at the end.
- Line 2: the new sentence with the missing part between two `=` signs:
  `start text = ANSWER = end text`. Line 2 never starts with `=`, never ends with `=`,
  and contains exactly two `=` signs. Start and end text are never empty.
- The answer is 2–5 words, contains the key word unchanged, and makes the new sentence mean
  the same as the first one. Accept contracted and full forms with `|`.
- Exactly two lines between `[transform]` and `[/transform]`. One item per block.

### Odd one out – `[odd]`
```
[odd] timber, bronze, alabaster, *skylight
```
- Words separated by commas, exactly one marked with `*` (the odd one). Words contain no commas.

### Categorising – `[sort]`
```
[sort]
Materials: timber, bronze, alabaster
Spaces: study, terrace, kitchen
[/sort]
```
- One `Category: item, item, item` per line. At least two categories. Each item belongs to one
  category only.

### Discussion prompt – `[discuss]`
```
[discuss] Should architects tell one strong story, or leave space for the people who will live there?
```
- One open question per line. Not graded, no answer.


## 9. Where gaps `{…}` work

| Gaps WORK in | Gaps do NOT work in (braces show as text) |
|---|---|
| normal paragraphs and list items | `[tf]`, `[m]`, `[short]`, `[long]`, `[fix]`, `[transform]` |
| table cells (not the header row) | `[match]`, `[order]`, `[sort]`, `[odd]`, `[discuss]` |
| inside `[read]` and `[bank]` | `[note]`, `[vocab]`, `[phrases]`, `[roles]`, `[timeline]`, `[quote]` |
| | `[transcript]`, `[teacher]`, headings, the header, rubrics |


## 10. How answers are checked

- Not case-sensitive. Accents, extra spaces and final punctuation (`. ! ? , ; :`) are ignored.
  Curly and straight apostrophes count as the same.
- Everything else must match one alternative exactly. So list real variants with `|`:
  contractions (`it's|it is`), hyphens (`well-known|well known`), numbers (`3|three`),
  British and American spelling (`travelled|traveled`), optional articles (`a bottle tree|bottle tree`).


## 11. Common mistakes (wrong → right)

| Wrong | Right |
|---|---|
| `[fix] Wrong sentence.` + `= Right sentence.` with no `[/fix]` | add `[/fix]` on its own line |
| `[m] Question? - a * b - c [/m]` on one line | question and each option on its own line |
| `[long]` answer `= Suggested answer: A.\|B.` | `= A.` (one answer, no label, no `\|`) |
| `[transform]` line 2 `= The relationships with clients are = most.` | `The relationships with clients = are what Rob Mills values = most.` |
| `[fix]` with a correct sentence to "rewrite" | `[transform]` with a key word |
| `[bank + glass, separate]` where `separate` is a gap answer | extras that are not answers |
| `[bank]` text written as `1. …` `2. …` | plain sentences or a paragraph |
| `[quote “Rob Mills”]` (curly quotes) | `[quote "Rob Mills"]` |
| `[quote "Speaker 2"]` / `Speaker 1:` in transcripts | a real name or role |
| `[tf] The {skylight} connects the levels. [t]` | no gaps in `[tf]` |
| `[short] Question? = answer [/short]` | no closing tag for `[short]` |
| `1. [tf] …` or `a) [m] …` | tags at the very start of the line, no numbering |
| `[Music]` on a normal line | only inside `[transcript]` |
| `style: classic (serif)` | `style: classic` |
| ```` ``` ```` / `eof` / a summary after `[/teacher]` | nothing after the lesson |
| `## Exercise 3: Vocabulary` | `## Key vocabulary \| Pairs · 5 minutes` |
| An "Answer key" section | nothing: the page builds it |


## 12. Final checklist

Go through the file line by line before you deliver it:

1. Line 1 is `---`; the header uses only the keys in section 4; `style:` is one of the six words.
2. Every `##` has a ` | Interaction · minutes` detail and a `> ` rubric.
3. Every graded item is inside a `##` exercise.
4. Every block tag (section 6) has its closing tag on its own line; no single-line tag has one.
5. Every `[tf]` ends in `[t]` or `[f]`; every `[short]` has ` = answer`; every `[odd]` has one `*`.
6. Every `[m]` has 3–4 options, exactly one `*`, each option on its own line starting with `* ` or `- `.
7. Every `[fix]` has a wrong sentence and one `= ` line; every `[long]` has one `= ` line without `|`.
8. Every `[transform]` has exactly two lines; line 2 has exactly two `=`, text before the first and
   after the second; the key word appears in the answer.
9. `[bank +]` extras are not answers. Gaps appear only where section 9 allows.
10. Every tag uses straight quotes `"`. No line outside `[transcript]` starts with `[` unless it is a tag.
11. Every `[play]` has a valid source and `mm:ss` times with start before end.
12. Nothing comes after the last `[/teacher]`; no code fences, no answer key, no comments.
